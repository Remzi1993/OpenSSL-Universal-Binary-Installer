# The OpenSSL Universal Binary Installer

My goal is to provide an automatic way of building OpenSSL from source.
Compiling from source made easy!
If you need the latest version of OpenSSL just run this automatic bash script.
Build latest OpenSSL Universal Binary on UNIX systems.

## Features of the OpenSSL Universal Binary Installer

*   Useful comments included in the bash script (Main installer)
*   **Checks if you are running a 32-Bit or 64-Bit system** If you are on a 32-Bit it will compile native 32-bit code and the same goes for 64-Bit.
*   **After installation it will removes all unnecessary files**
*	Automatic way for UNIX Systems (OS X, Ubuntu and any other Linux distribution)
*   Downloads from source, so you are always up-to-date
*   Dynamic Loading of Object files(on some architecture)
*   Highly customisable

## How to get the OpenSSL Universal Binary Installer

If you are using git and properly you do, otherwise you wouldn't be here :)
Then use the following command:

	$ git clone git://github.com/Remzi1993/openssl-installer.git

## Quick install?

You are just a user who wants to install or update OpenSSL quickly?
Just run the following command:

	$ sudo OpenSSL-installer.sh

## The Author

OpenSSL Universal Binary Installer was originally developed by an internet guy tmiz.
Now I want to provide UNIX systems an easy way of downloading, compiling, installing and updating OpenSSL.
